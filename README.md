# ðŸš€ Breno AraÃºjo

**FullStack Developer**

Hi there! I'm **Breno**, born in 1998, and I've been coding since 2012. My passion for technology started early when I was inspired to learn after years of curiosity about computers. I've always been fascinated by **automation** and **security**, and I believe those interests have guided me throughout my DEV journey.

I began my studies with a technical course in Computer Networking and later pursued a degree in Computer Engineering. What truly excites me is bringing projects to life â€” turning ideas into real, functional solutions is what I love most in the development world.
